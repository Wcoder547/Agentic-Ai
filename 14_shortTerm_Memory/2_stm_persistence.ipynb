      "\n",
      "- Born June 3, 1966, in Lahore, Pakistan, he's regarded as one of the greatest left-arm fast bowlers ever, nicknamed the **Sultan of Swing** for his mastery of swing and seam bowling.[3][5]\n",
      "- He played 104 Tests (414 wickets at 23.62 average, best 7/119) and 356 ODIs (502 wickets at 23.52 average, best 5/15), forming a legendary opening partnership with Waqar Younis.[1][4][5]\n",
      "- Key achievements include captaining Pakistan to a 2-0 Test series win in England (1996), a clean sweep against West Indies (1997-98), and starring in the 1992 World Cup victory with unforgettable dismissals in the final.[1][2][3]\n",
      "- He scored three Test centuries, including an unbeaten 257 vs. Zimbabwe, and holds the List A wickets record with 881.[1][5]\n",
      "- Inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame in 2009; also played for Lancashire, taking 31 first-class wickets in 1988 and leading them in 1998.[2][4]\n",
