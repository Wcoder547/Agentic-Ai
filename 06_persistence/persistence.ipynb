       " 'explanation': 'The joke \"Why did the samosa go to therapy? It had too many **deep-fried** emotions and couldn\\'t handle the **fillings** anymore!\" is a pun-based pun on the characteristics of a **samosa**, a popular deep-fried pastry snack filled with spiced potatoes, meat, or vegetables.[1]\\n\\n- **Deep-fried emotions**: Plays on how samosas are cooked by **deep-frying** (immersing in hot oil), twisting it into the samosa having overly intense or \"fried\" feelings that overwhelm it, leading to therapy.\\n- **Fillings**: Doubly puns on the samosa\\'s literal **stuffing** (its savory interior) and emotional \"fillings\" (as in, being stuffed full of unresolved issues it can\\'t manage).\\n\\nThis anthropomorphizes the food item, common in food-themed humor, for a lighthearted take on mental health struggles.[1]'}"
